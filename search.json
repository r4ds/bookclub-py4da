row numbers are not stored in the first column. Missing values are written as empty strings, we can specify a placeholder with na_rep = \"NA\":\n\npenguins_custom.to_csv(\n  \"data/penguins_custom.csv\", \n  index = False,\n  na_rep = \"NA\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Other Delimited Formats\n\nReading\nIn case your tabular data makes pandas trip up and you need a little extra manual processing, you can use Python’s built in csv module.\nLet’s read in the penguins dataset the hard, manual way.\n\nimport csv\n\npenguin_reader = csv.reader(penguins)\n\nprint(penguin_reader)\n\n<_csv.reader object at 0x0000026704996340>\n\n\nNow we have the _csv_reader object.\nNext, Wes iterated through the reader to print the lines, which seems to only give me the row with my headings.\n\nfor line in penguin_reader:\n  print(line)\n\n['species']\n['island']\n['bill_length_mm']\n['bill_depth_mm']\n['flipper_length_mm']\n['body_mass_g']\n['sex']\n['month']\n['day']\n['year']\n\n\nWe’ll keep following along to wrangle it into a form we can use:\n\nwith open(\"data/penguins.csv\") as penguin_reader:\n  lines = list(csv.reader(penguin_reader))\n  \nheader, values = lines[0], lines[1:]\n\nprint(header)\nprint(values[5])\n\n['species', 'island', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex', 'month', 'day', 'year']\n['Adelie', 'Torgersen', '39.3', '20.6', '190', '3650', 'male', '3', '3', '2007']\n\n\nNow we have two lists: header and values. We use a dictionary of data columns and the expression zip(*values). This combination of dictionary comprehension and expression is generally faster than iterating through a loop. However, Wes warns that this can use a lot of memory on large files.\n\npenguin_dict = {h: v for h, v in zip(header, zip(*values))}\n\n# too big to print and I'm not sure how to print a select few key-value pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall\n\n\n\nFor a reminder on dictionary comprehensions, see Chapter 3.\n\n\nNow to finally get this into a usable dataframe we’ll use pandas DataFrame from_dict method!\n\npenguin_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(penguin_dict)\npenguin_df.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      species\n      island\n      bill_length_mm\n      bill_depth_mm\n      flipper_length_mm\n      body_mass_g\n      sex\n      month\n      day\n      year\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Adelie\n      Torgersen\n      39.1\n      18.7\n      181\n      3750\n      male\n      4\n      10\n      2007\n    \n    \n      1\n      Adelie\n      Torgersen\n      39.5\n      17.4\n      186\n      3800\n      female\n      3\n      6\n      2007\n    \n    \n      2\n      Adelie\n      Torgersen\n      40.3\n      18\n      195\n      3250\n      female\n      7\n      22\n      2007\n    \n    \n      3\n      Adelie\n      Torgersen\n      NA\n      NA\n      NA\n      NA\n      NA\n      2\n      13\n      2007\n    \n    \n      4\n      Adelie\n      Torgersen\n      36.7\n      19.3\n      193\n      3450\n      female\n      8\n      21\n      2007\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncsv.Dialect\nSince there are many kinds of delimited files, string quoting conventions, and line terminators, you may find yourself wanting to define a “Dialect” to read in your delimited file. The options available are found in Table 6.3.\nYou can either define a csv.Dialect subclass or pass dialect parameters to csv.reader.\n\n# option 1\n\n## define a dialect subclass\n\nclass my_dialect(csv.Dialect):\n    lineterminator = \"\\n\"\n    delimiter = \";\"\n    quotechar = '\"'\n    quoting = csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL\n    \n## use the subclass\n\nreader = csv.reader(penguins, dialect = my_dialect)\n\n# option 2\n\n## pass just dialect parameters\n\nreader = csv.reader(penguins, delimiter = \",\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap for when to use what?\n\n\n\nFor most data, pandas read_* functions, plus the overwhelming number of options, will likely get you close to what you need.\nIf there are additional, minor wrangling needs, you can try using Python’s csv.reader with either a csv.Dialect subclass or just by passing in dialect parameters.\nIf you have complicated or multicharacter delimiters, you’ll likely need to import the string module and use the split method or regular expression method re.split.\n\n\n\n\nWriting\ncsv.writer is the companion to csv.reader with the same dialect and format options. The first argument in open is the path and filename you want to write to and the second argument \"w\" makes the file writeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPython documentation notes that newline=\"\" should be specified in case there are newlines embedded inside quoted fields to ensure they are interpreted correctly.\n\n\n\nwith open(\"data/write_data.csv\", \"w\", newline = \"\") as f:\n    writer = csv.writer(f, dialect = my_dialect)\n    writer.writerow((\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"))\n    writer.writerow((\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"))\n    writer.writerow((\"4\", \"5\", \"6\"))\n    writer.writerow((\"7\", \"8\", \"9\"))\n\n\n\nJavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data\nStandard format for HTTP requests between web browsers, applications, and APIs.

Also, the module is not secure – pickle data can be maliciously tampered with. Python docs recommend signing data with hmac to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with.\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Excel Files\npd.ExcelFile class or pd.read_excel functions use packages xlrd (for older .xlx files) and openpyxl (for newer .xlsx files), which must be installed separately from pandas.\nconda install xlrd openpyxl\npd.read_excel takes most of the same arguments as pd.read_csv.\n\npenguins_excel = pd.read_excel(\n  \"data/penguins.xlsx\", \n  index_col = \"species\",\n  parse_dates = {\"date\": [\"month\", \"day\", \"year\"]}\n)\n\npenguins_excel.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      date\n      island\n      bill_length_mm\n      bill_depth_mm\n      flipper_length_mm\n      body_mass_g\n      sex\n    \n    \n      species\n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Adelie\n      2007-04-10\n      Torgersen\n      39.1\n      18.7\n      181.0\n      3750.0\n      male\n    \n    \n      Adelie\n      2007-03-06\n      Torgersen\n      39.5\n      17.4\n      186.0\n      3800.0\n      female\n    \n    \n      Adelie\n      2007-07-22\n      Torgersen\n      40.3\n      18.0\n      195.0\n      3250.0\n      female\n    \n    \n      Adelie\n      2007-02-13\n      Torgersen\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n      NaN\n    \n    \n      Adelie\n      2007-08-21\n      Torgersen\n      36.7\n      19.3\n      193.0\n      3450.0\n      female\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nTo read multiple sheets, use pd.ExcelFile.\n\npenguins_sheets = pd.ExcelFile(\"data/penguins_sheets.xlsx\")\n\nprint(\"Available sheet names:\", penguins_sheets.sheet_names)\n\npenguins_sheets\n\nAvailable sheet names: ['chinstrap', 'gentoo', 'adelie']\n\n\n<pandas.io.excel._base.ExcelFile at 0x26705acdd90>\n\n\nThen we can parse all sheets into a dictionary by specifying the sheet_name argument as None.

to_excel:\n\nchinstrap.to_excel(\"data/chinstrap.xlsx\")\n\nIf you want to write to multiple sheets, create an ExcelWriter class and then write the data to it:\n\ngentoo = sheets[\"gentoo\"].head(5)\n\nwriter = pd.ExcelWriter(\"data/chinstrap_gentoo.xlsx\")\n\nchinstrap.to_excel(writer, sheet_name = \"chinstrap\")\n\ngentoo.to_excel(writer, sheet_name = \"gentoo\")\n\nwriter.save()\n\n\n\nHDF5 Format\nHierarchical data format (HDF) is used in Python, C, Java, Julia, MATLAB, and others for storing big scientific array data (multiple datasets and metadata within one file). HDF5 can be used to efficiently read/write chunks of large arrays.\nThe PyTables package must first be installed.\nconda install pytables\n\npip install tables # the package is called \"tables\" in PyPI\npandas provides an dictionary-like-class for HDF5 files called HDFStore:\n\nstore = pd.HDFStore(\"data/pets.h5\")\n\nstore[\"pets\"] = pets_df\nstore[\"pets\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name\n      type\n      sex\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Mai\n      cat\n      Female\n    \n    \n      1\n      Tai\n      cat\n      Male\n    \n    \n      2\n      Skye\n      cat\n      Female\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nHDFStore can store data as a fixed or as a table schema. Table allows querying but is generally slower.\n\npets_df.to_hdf(\"data/petnames.h5\", \"pets\", format = \"table\")\npd.read_hdf(\"data/petnames.h5\", \"pets\", where=[\"columns = name\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Mai\n    \n    \n      1\n      Tai\n    \n    \n      2\n      Skye\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should I use HDF5?\n\n\n\nWes recommends using HDF5 for write-once, read-many datasets that are worked with locally. If your data is stored on remote servers, then you may try other binary formats designed for distributed storage (for example, Apache Parquet).\n\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with Web APIs\nTo access data from APIs, Wes suggests using the requests package.\nconda install requests\nLet’s pull from this free zoo animal API.\n\nimport requests\n\nurl = \"https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com/animals/rand\"\n\nresp = requests.get(url)\n\nresp.raise_for_status()\n\nprint(\"HTTP status\", resp)\n\nanimal = resp.json()\nanimal\n\nanimal_df = pd.DataFrame([animal]) # important to wrap the dictionary object into a list\nanimal_df\n\nHTTP status <Response [200]>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      name\n      latin_name\n      animal_type\n      active_time\n      length_min\n      length_max\n      weight_min\n      weight_max\n      lifespan\n      habitat\n      diet\n      geo_range\n      image_link\n      id\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Brazilian Porcupine\n      Coendou prehensilis\n      Mammal\n      Nocturnal\n      1.5\n      1.7\n      9\n      11\n      17\n      Tropical rainforest\n      Leaves, bark, fruits, shoots and small animals\n      Northern and eastern South America\n      https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons...\n      45\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that the dictionary is wrapped into a list. If it isn’t, then you will get the following error: ValueError: If using all scalar values, you must pass an index.\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with Databases\nSome popular SQL-based relational databases are: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3. We can use pandas to load the results of a SQL query into a DataFrame.\nImport sqlite3 and create a database.\n\nimport sqlite3\n\ncon = sqlite3.connect(\"data/data.sqlite\")\n\nThis creates a table.\n\nquery = \"\"\"\n  CREATE TABLE states\n  (Capital VARCHAR(20), State VARCHAR(20),\n  x1 REAL, x2 INTEGER\n);\"\"\"\n\ncon.execute(query)\n\ncon.commit()\n\nThis inserts the rows of data:\n\ndata = [(\"Atlanta\", \"Georgia\", 1.25, 6), (\"Seattle\", \"Washington\", 2.6, 3), (\"Sacramento\", \"California\", 1.7, 5)]\n        \nstmt = \"INSERT INTO states VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)\"\n\ncon.executemany(stmt, data)\n\ncon.commit()\n\nNow we can look at the data:\n\ncursor = con.execute(\"SELECT * FROM states\")\n\nrows = cursor.fetchall()\n\nrows\n\n[('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),\n ('Seattle', 'Washington', 2.6, 3),\n ('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5),\n ('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),\n ('Seattle', 'Washington', 2.6, 3),\n ('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5),\n ('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),\n ('Seattle', 'Washington', 2.6, 3),\n ('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5),\n ('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),\n ('Seattle', 'Washington', 2.6, 3),\n ('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5),\n ('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),\n ('Seattle', 'Washington', 2.6, 3),\n ('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5),\n ('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),\n ('Seattle', 'Washington', 2.6, 3),\n ('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5),\n ('Atlanta', 'Georgia', 1.25, 6),\n ('Seattle', 'Washington', 2.6, 3),\n ('Sacramento', 'California', 1.7, 5)]\n\n\nTo get the data into a pandas DataFrame, we’ll need to provide column names in the cursor.description.\n\nprint(cursor.description)\n\npd.DataFrame(rows, columns = [x[0] for x in cursor.description])\n\n(('Capital', None, None, None, None, None, None), ('State', None, None, None, None, None, None), ('x1', None, None, None, None, None, None), ('x2', None, None, None, None, None, None))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Capital\n      State\n      x1\n      x2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      1\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      2\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      3\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      4\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      5\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      6\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      7\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      8\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      9\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      10\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      11\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      12\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      13\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      14\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      15\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      16\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      17\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      18\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      19\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      20\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nAs per usual, Wes likes to show us the manual way first and then the easier version. Using SQLAlchemy, we can must less verbosely create our DataFrame.\n\nimport sqlalchemy as sqla\n\ndb = sqla.create_engine(\"sqlite:///data/data.sqlite\")\n\npd.read_sql(\"SELECT * FROM states\", db)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Capital\n      State\n      x1\n      x2\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      1\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      2\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      3\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      4\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      5\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      6\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      7\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      8\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      9\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      10\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      11\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      12\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      13\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      14\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      15\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      16\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      17\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5\n    \n    \n      18\n      Atlanta\n      Georgia\n      1.25\n      6\n    \n    \n      19\n      Seattle\n      Washington\n      2.60\n      3\n    \n    \n      20\n      Sacramento\n      California\n      1.70\n      5"
