* Pandas is a major tool in Python data analysis

* Works with Numpy, adding support for tabular / heterogenous data

## Import conventions: 

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```


## Panda's primary data structures

* Series: One dimensional object containing a sequence of values of the same type.

* DataFrame: Tabular data, similar (and inspired by) R dataframe.

* Other structures will be introduced as they arise, e.g. Index and Groupby objects.

### Series

```{python}
obj = pd.Series([4,7,-4,3], index = ["A","B","C","D"])
obj
```

The `index` is optional, if not specified it will default to 0 through N-1 

#### Selection

Select elements or sub-Series by labels, sets of labels, boolean arrays ...
    
```{python}
obj['A']
```

```{python}
obj[['A','C']]
```

```{python}
obj[obj > 3]
```

#### Other things you can do

* Numpy functions and Numpy-like operations work as expected:

```{python}
obj*3
```
 
```{python}
np.exp(obj)
```

* Series can be created from and converted to a dictionary

```{python}
obj.to_dict()
```

* Series can be converted to numpy array:

```{python}
obj.to_numpy()
```


* Missing values and can be tested for with `isna` or `notna` methods

```{python}
test = pd.Series([np.nan, 3, 4, 5])
pd.isna(test)
```


### DataFrame

* Represents table of data

* Has row index *index* and column index *column*

* Common way to create is from a dictionary, but see *Table 5.1* for more!

```{python}

test = pd.DataFrame({"cars":['Chevy','Ford','Dodge','BMW'],'MPG':[14,15,16,12], 'Year':[1979, 1980, 2001, 2020]})
test
```

* If you want a non-default index, it can be specified just like with Series.

* `head(n)` / `tail(n)` - return the first / last n rows, 5 by default

#### Selecting 

* Can retrieve columns or sets of columns by using `obj[...]`:

```{python}
test['cars']
```

Note that we got a `Series` here.

```{python}
test[['cars','MPG']]
```

* Dot notation can also be used (`test.cars`) as long as the column names are valid identifiers

* *Rows* can be retrieved with `iloc[...]` and `loc[...]`:

   - `loc` retrieves by index

   - `iloc` retrieves by position. 

 
#### Modifying / Creating Columns

* Columns can be modified (and created) by assignment:

```{python}
test['MPG^2'] = test['MPG']**2
test
```
 
* `del` keyword can be used to drop columns, or `drop` method can be used to do so non-destructively


### Index object 

* Index objects are used for holding axis labels and other metadata

```{python}
test.index
```

* Can change the index, in this case replacing the default:

```{python}
# Create index from one of the columns
test.index = test['cars']  

 # remove 'cars' column since i am using as an index now.  s
test=test.drop('cars', axis = "columns")  # or axis  = 1
test
```

* Note the `axis` keyword argument above, many DataFrame methods use this.

* Above I changed a column into an index.  Often you want to go the other way, this can be done with `reset_index`: 

```{python}
test.reset_index()  # Note this doesn't actually change test
```


* Columns are an index as well:
```{python}
test.columns
```

* Indexes act like immutable sets,  see *Table 5.2* in book for Index methods and properties

## Essential Functionality

### Reindexing and dropping

* `reindex` creats a *new* object with the values arranged according to the new index.  Missing values are used if necessary, or you can use optional fill methods.  You can use `iloc` and `loc` to reindex as well.

* `drop` , illustrated above can drop rows or columns. In addition to using `axis` you can use `columns` or `index`. Again these make copies.

```{python}
test.drop(columns = 'MPG')
```

```{python}
test.drop(index = ['Ford', 'BMW'])
```

### Indexing, Selection and Filtering

#### Series
* For Series, indexing is similar to Numpy, except you can use the index as well as integers.

```{python}
obj = pd.Series(np.arange(4.), index=["a", "b", "c", "d"])
obj[0:3]
```

```{python}
obj['a':'c']
```

```{python}
obj[obj<2]
```

```{python}
obj[['a','d']]
```

* *However*, preferred way is to use `loc` for selection by *index* and `iloc` for selection by position. This is to avoid the issue where the `index` is itself integers.

```{python}
obj.loc[['a','d']]
```

```{python}
obj.iloc[1]
```

* Note that as with Numpy, if a range or a set of indexes is used, a Series is returned. If a single item is requested, you get just that item.

#### DataFrame

* Selecting with `df[...]` for a DataFrame retrieves one or more columns as we have seen, if you select a single column you get a Series

* There are some special cases, indexing with a boolean selects *rows*, as does selecting with a slice:

```{python}
test[0:1]
```

```{python}
test[test['MPG'] < 15]
```

* `iloc` and `loc` can be used to select rows as illustrated before, but can also be used to select columns or subsets of rows/columns


```{python}
test.loc[:,['Year','MPG']]
```

```{python}
test.loc['Ford','MPG']
```

* These work with slices and booleans as well!  The following says "give me all the rows with MPG more then 15, and the columns starting from Year"

```{python}
test.loc[test['MPG'] > 15, 'Year':]
```

* Indexing options are fully illustrated in the book and *Table 5.4* 

* Be careful with *chained indexing*:

```{python}
test[test['MPG']> 15].loc[:,'MPG'] = 18
```

Here we are assigning to a 'slice', which is probably not what is intended. You will get  a warning and a recommendation to fix it by using one `loc`:

```{python}
test.loc[test['MPG']> 15 ,'MPG'] = 18
test
```

### Rule of Thumb

Avoid chained indexing when doing assignments
:::

### Arithmetic and Data Alignment

* Pandas can make it simpler to work with objects that have different indexes, usually 'doing the right thing'

```{python}
s1 = pd.Series([7.3, -2.5, 3.4, 1.5], index=["a", "c", "d", "e"])
s2 = pd.Series([-2.1, 3.6, -1.5, 4, 3.1], index=["a", "c", "e", "f", "g"])
s1+s2
```

* Fills can be specified by using methods:

```{python}
s1.add(s2, fill_value = 0)
```

* See *Table 5.5* for list of these methods.

* You can also do arithmetic between *DataFrame*s and *Series* in a way that is similar to Numpy. 

### Function Application and Mapping

* Numpy *ufuncs* also work with Pandas objects. 

```{python}
frame = pd.DataFrame(np.random.standard_normal((4, 3)),
                         columns=list("bde"),
                         index=["Utah", "Ohio", "Texas", "Oregon"])
frame
```

```{python}
np.abs(frame)
```

* `apply` can be used to apply a function on 1D arrays to each column or row:

```{python}
frame.apply(np.max, axis = 'rows') #'axis' is optional here, default is rows
```

Applying accross columns is common, especially to combine different columns in some way:

```{python}

frame['max'] = frame.apply(np.max, axis = 'columns')
frame
```

* Many more examples of this in the book.


### Sorting and Ranking

* `sort_index` will sort with the index (on either axis for *DataFrame*)
* `sort_values` is used to sort by values or a particular column

```{python}
test.sort_values('MPG')
```

* `rank` will assign ranks from on through the number of data points.


## Summarizing and Computing Descriptive Statistics

```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame([[1.4, np.nan], [7.1, -4.5],
                      [np.nan, np.nan], [0.75, -1.3]],
                      index=["a", "b", "c", "d"],
                      columns=["one", "two"])
df
```

### Some Examples:


Sum over rows:
```{python}
df.sum()
```

Sum over columns:
```{python}
# Sum Rows
df.sum(axis="columns")
```

Extremely useful is `describe`:

```{python}
df.describe()
```

Book contains more examples and a full list of summary statistics and related methods.

### Correlation and Covariance

* These need a pair of arguments. 
  
* `corr` is a method on Series that takes a second Series as argument:


```{python}
df = pd.DataFrame({"A":np.random.normal(size=20), 
                   "B":np.random.normal(size=20)})
df['A'].corr(df['B'])
```

* DataFrame `corr` / `cov` return full corr / cov matrix as a DataFrame:


```{python}
df.corr()
```

* To do pairwise correlations there is also `corrwith`  

### Unique Values / Counts


* `unique`: return unique values

* `value_counts`: value frequencies

* `isin`: vectorized set membership, useful for generating masks!

```{python}
test[test.index.isin(['Chevy','Ford'])] # remeber boolean index selects *rows*
```

## Summary

* Primary Panda's data structures:

    - Series

    - DataFrame

* Many ways to access and transform these objects.  Key ones are:

   - `[]` : access an element(s) of a `Series` or columns(s) of a `DataFrame`

   - `loc[r ,c]` : access a row / column / cell by the `index`.

   - `iloc[i, j]` : access ar row / column / cell by the integer position.
